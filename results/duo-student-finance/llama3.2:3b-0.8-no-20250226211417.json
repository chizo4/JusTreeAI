    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Nationality",
    "reasoning": "Since Yasmin has Dutch nationality, she is eligible for student finance as a Dutch citizen. However, the student finance policy does not provide grants for students from other EU countries or non-EU countries without residence in the Netherlands."

{
    "case_id": 57,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Recognition",
    "reasoning": "Since Julia's program is at an unaccredited university, it does not meet the recognition criteria set by DUO student finance. This is the most important factor in this case, as it automatically disqualifies her from receiving a grant. The other factors (age, duration, etc.) do not outweigh this issue."
},
{
    "case_id": 91,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Age",
    "reasoning": "Since Sophie is 26 years old, she is above the maximum age of 23 to be eligible for a DUO student finance grant as per Dutch law."
},
{
    "case_id": 53,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Age",
    "reasoning": "Tom is 20 years old, and since he is over 18, he does not meet the age requirement for the grant. The other factors do not outweigh this critical factor in this case."
},
{
    "case_id": 62,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Enrollment",
    "reasoning": "Since Layla is enrolled in an unrecognized vocational training course, she is not eligible for the student finance grant. The fact that the course is recognized or not does not impact her eligibility in this case. As an unmarried teenager under 18 years old, she automatically receives a grant, but her enrollment status takes precedence and leads to non-eligibility."
},
{
    "case_id": 86,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Duration",
    "reasoning": "Since Amir is pursuing a recognized one-year master's degree, his program duration is relatively short and might not be eligible for the grant. The DUO student finance program typically supports longer programs or those with additional requirements. Although it's a part-time program, the one-year duration seems too short to meet the eligibility criteria."
},
{
    "case_id": 90,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Recognition",
    "reasoning": "Since Leo's program is at an unaccredited training center, it is unlikely to be recognized by DUO student finance. Therefore, his grant eligibility is determined as NotEligible due to lack of recognition."
},
{
    "case_id": 75,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Nationality",
    "reasoning": "Since Angela is not under 18 years old, she does not meet the criteria of MBO_Under18. This factor takes priority over other eligibility criteria in this case."
},
{
    "case_id": 84,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Program",
    "reasoning": "Since Jan is pursuing a dual master's degree at Delft University of Technology, which is not a recognized HBO program under the Dutch student finance system and exceeds the 2-year maximum duration for recognition."
},
{
    "case_id": 77,
    "prediction": "NotEligible",
    "impact_node": "Recognition",
    "reasoning": "Fatima is pursuing a program at a private, non-accredited university, which does not meet the recognition criteria. This makes her ineligible for the grant."
